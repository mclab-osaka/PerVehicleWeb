                            As the frontier of vehicular technology continues to expand, the integration of cooperative
                            systems,
                            particularly through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and Roadside Perception Units
                            (RSPUs), emerges as a pivotal force in redefining road safety, efficiency, and vehicular
                            autonomy.
                            This talk delves into the transformative potential of networked RSPUs in enhancing
                            autonomous
                            driving capabilities, underpinned by the robust foundation of V2X communication. It explores
                            the
                            innovative concept of infrastructure-assisted vehicular communication, spotlighting the
                            pivotal
                            role
                            of RSPUs in facilitating cooperative perception â€“ a critical component for achieving
                            comprehensive
                            situational awareness and bolstering the cooperative intelligent transport system (ITS). By
                            harnessing the synergy of V2X and advanced middleware, such as AutowareV2X and AutoMCM, the
                            discourse presents a comprehensive overview of the seamless integration of autonomous
                            vehicles
                            within the intelligent vehicular ecosystem. Through a series of rigorous field tests and
                            simulation
                            experiments, the talk showcases the efficacy of these advanced systems, highlighting their
                            proficiency in delivering vital messages with minimal latency, even under challenging
                            traffic
                            conditions. Moreover, it underscores the significance of collective perception and maneuver
                            coordination in optimizing vehicular operations, thereby paving the way for a future where
                            autonomous vehicles and intelligent infrastructure coalesce to form a harmonious, safe, and
                            highly
                            efficient transportation network. The insights shared in this talk not only reflect a deep
                            understanding of current technological advancements but also chart a course for future
                            innovations
                            in the realm of pervasive computing for vehicular systems.

                            With modern vehicles already becoming more and more computing objects than mechanical entities, software-defined
                            vehicles have been dreamed to solve many connectivity and computing related challenges still existing in the automotive software
                            community. These include, but are not limited, how to share resources, run open the air updates, orchestrate internal and external
                            data management, and utilize all the capabilities future 5G and beyond edge-cloud infrastructure could offer. Apart from the
                            visions, many pilots have been run both in-house and with public funding in the European level where focus is shifting to
                            open-source solutions. With wide legacy of research on V2V, ad hoc networks, software defined networks, and many related topics,
                            it would be imagined the software-defined paradigm for vehicles is just beyond the corner. However, when addressing 100+ years of
                            industry, such a paradigm shift requires new levels of knowledge transfer and mutual understanding that can also lead us as
                            computer scientists rethink our values and goals. This talk addresses some of the technical challenges but mainly discusses the
                            whole concept of software-defined vehicles and vehicle-edge-cloud computing in a practical level with some hints of philosophy,
                            economy, and human nature.
