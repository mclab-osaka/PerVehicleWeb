                <p>
                    4th International Workshop on Pervasive Computing for Vehicular Systems (PerVehicle 2022)
                    aims to
                    provide researchers and practitioners a forum for presenting and discussing research
                    challenges on
                    pervasive and mobile computing technologies for intelligent vehicular systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vehicular systems have become more significant for our society. For example, connected
                    vehicles will
                    provide new network architectures and middleware to enable new pervasive applications like
                    intelligent platooning, cooperative optimization of traffic flows, automated vehicles and
                    intelligent vehicle-pedestrian safety systems. In addition, drones and UAVs will bring new
                    concepts
                    and ideas for smart mobility and society. Pervasive computing technologies including
                    wireless
                    networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and
                    smart
                    devices, will play more important roles in designing, managing and realizing intelligent,
                    smart
                    vehicular systems. The main focus of this workshop is on such pervasive and mobile computing
                    for/by
                    vehicular systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We solicit technical papers describing original, previously unpublished research, not
                    currently
                    under review by another conference or journal. Submissions should clearly identify how they
                    relate
                    to issues on pervasive computing and vehicular systems. Contributions describing an overall
                    working
                    system and reporting real world deployment experiences are particularly of interest.
                </p>

                <h2>Paper submission</h2>
                <p>
                    Paper submission has to be done via EDAS. If you don't have an EDAS account, please,
                    register first
                    (it is free) via the following.
                </p>
