                        <p class="mb-2">Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) have rapidly evolved, finding applications across various domains in both urban and rural areas. Despite their widespread use—ranging from logistics, such as on-demand delivery of food and parcels, to surveillance of people and traffic, and environmental monitoring—their deployment in urban settings remains constrained due to concerns of authorities and the general public about the safety and reliability of such large-scale deployments. One reason for this is, that the capability to monitor and manage large amounts of UASs safely and efficiently using Unmanned Aerial Traffic Management (UTM) systems is still lacking. Such systems would provide for many services to UAS operators like requesting flight permission, deconflicting and remote piloting. But most importantly, UTM systems must provide a mechanism for airspace monitoring in which the positions of UASs are reliably known at any time. Although concepts for UTM systems exist all around the world, the communication technology to support such concepts to deploy among UAVs from different operators is still at an early stage.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-2">In order to overcome this problem, drone-to-drone communication plays a key role. Hence, in the VEREDUS project, a solution for direct drone-to-drone communication was developed including the design of hardware, antennas and software. Within the VEREDUS project, we identified requirements and challenges for a communication system supporting both current and future applications, complementing today's communication technology (such as C-V2X or IEEE 802.11bd) and enabling scalable solutions for the future. The performance of the network was assessed using a traffic and network simulator.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-2">Our keynote outlines the key requirements and challenges identified in the project and presents a solution that supports both current UAS applications and future UAS networks. We also showcase the project's outcomes, including the design, implementation, and integration of solutions into commercially available UAVs, validated through simulations and real-world experiments.</p>
