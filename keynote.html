                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span>
                        As the frontier of vehicular technology continues to expand, the integration of cooperative
                        systems,
                        particularly through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and Roadside Perception Units
                        (RSPUs), emerges as a pivotal force in redefining road safety, efficiency, and vehicular
                        autonomy.
                        This talk delves into the transformative potential of networked RSPUs in enhancing autonomous
                        driving capabilities, underpinned by the robust foundation of V2X communication. It explores the
                        innovative concept of infrastructure-assisted vehicular communication, spotlighting the pivotal
                        role
                        of RSPUs in facilitating cooperative perception – a critical component for achieving
                        comprehensive
                        situational awareness and bolstering the cooperative intelligent transport system (ITS). By
                        harnessing the synergy of V2X and advanced middleware, such as AutowareV2X and AutoMCM, the
                        discourse presents a comprehensive overview of the seamless integration of autonomous vehicles
                        within the intelligent vehicular ecosystem. Through a series of rigorous field tests and
                        simulation
                        experiments, the talk showcases the efficacy of these advanced systems, highlighting their
                        proficiency in delivering vital messages with minimal latency, even under challenging traffic
                        conditions. Moreover, it underscores the significance of collective perception and maneuver
                        coordination in optimizing vehicular operations, thereby paving the way for a future where
                        autonomous vehicles and intelligent infrastructure coalesce to form a harmonious, safe, and
                        highly
                        efficient transportation network. The insights shared in this talk not only reflect a deep
                        understanding of current technological advancements but also chart a course for future
                        innovations
                        in the realm of pervasive computing for vehicular systems.
